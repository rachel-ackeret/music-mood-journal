## Project Proposal

### Overview

A app that takes in user parameters about how the user is feeling on a day and produces a related song. 

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

- The Spotify API: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/
- Spotipy: https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.18.0/#installation
- 

### Data

- User email, password, linked Spotify account
- Saved journal entry, mood rating, with resulting song link/embed. 
  -Date
- 


### Roadmap

#### MVP

- User login
- User can create, edit, delete journal/ranking entries
- User can create, edit, delete journal + song match
- Associate song from Spotify with journal entry https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.18.0/

#### 2.0

- Fine-tune algo: search spotify based on user's journal/ranking entry for that day filtered through their recently played artists
- 

#### 3.0
- Can set default genre preference
