## Project Proposal

### Overview

A app that takes in user parameters about how the user is feeling on a day and produces a related song. 

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

- The Spotify API: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/quick-start/
- Spotipy: https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.18.0/#installation
- 

### Data

- User email, password, linked Spotify account
- Saved journal entry, mood rating, with resulting song link/embed. 
  -Date
- 


### Roadmap

#### MVP

- User login
- User can create, edit, delete journal/ranking entries
- User can create, edit, delete journal + song match
- Associate song from Spotify with journal entry https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.18.0/

#### 2.0

- Set up D3 for a visual graph display of inputs
- Set up React for use of components
  - Something with the React setup -- embeds are erroring out because there are too many, wouldl iek to only display limited number of cards/journal entries
  - Create options for editing and deleting posts. 
  - Editing/Deleting journal entry aspects
- Set up Oauth to gather user data for genre/artist preferences (lower priority)
  - Fine-tune algo: filter spotify recommendation through user's recently played artists, or top genres
- (Optional) Social feature, friendships with other users to see their daily song. 

- weather api
- social media sharing
